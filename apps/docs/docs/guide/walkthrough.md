# Walkthrough

## Fresh Start

Once you have installed and opened CLUI, you will be met with a screen that looks like this: 

<figure style="margin: 0;">
  <img src="/images/fresh-start.png" alt="empty CLUI dashboard">
  <figcaption style="opacity: 0.75; font-size: 0.75em;">
    (CLUI Dashboard)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

To create your first flow, click the blue `+` sign in the bottom right corner!

## Creating Your First Flow

Once you have clicked the blue `+` sign in the bottom right corner, you'll see a page like this that is prepopulated with some data that will create a "Hello World" flow:

<figure style="margin: 0;">
  <img src="/images/create-flow-1.png" alt="Create CLUI flow page">
  <figcaption style="opacity: 0.75; font-size: 0.75em;">
    (Create CLUI Flow page)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

**Title**: Title that will be displayed on the dashboard.

**Description**: Description that will be displayed on the dashboard.

**Dependencies**: Dependencies required by your flow (i.e. `ffmpeg`, `python`). Use the `url` property to render a link to the given dependency or omit it to just render the dependency name as text.

**CWD**: Working directory from which the commands in your flow should be executed.

**Inputs**: Inputs required for your flow. Inputs can be of type `string` or `file`. `string` inputs allow for text input, and `file` inputs enable drag-and-drop file selection. We recommend using a consistent naming scheme that won't be used within your `command`; we like to use a short, simple name surrounded by square braces like `[message]` or `[inputFile]`.

**Command Builder**: Construct the command to be executed. Use the `input`s' `name`s within the command builder string to represent their corresponding values during execution. Look into the `Variable Map` for key-value pairs of the text to replace and the replacement text. For example, a command builder input of `echo "Current Timestamp is @NOW"` will run the command `echo "Current Timestamp is 1684681404139"` (your timestamp may vary ðŸ˜…).

**Tags**: Tags for your flows for searching / categorization.

<figure style="margin: 0;">
  <img src="/images/create-flow-2.png" alt="Create CLUI flow page, part 2">
  <figcaption style="opacity: 0.75; font-size: 0.75em;">
    (Create CLUI Flow page, part 2)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Once you are ready, hit the `Submit Flow` button at the bottom of the form and you will be brought to the Flow Execution page.

## Flow execution

After your flow has been created, it will appear on your CLUI dashboard as such:

<figure style="margin: 0;">
  <img src="/images/clui-dashboard.png" alt="CLUI Dashboard with one existing flow">
  <figcaption style="opacity: 0.75; font-size: 0.75em;">
    (CLUI Dashboard with one existing flow)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

And if we click into it (or haven't navigated away from it after successfully creating our flow), we will see the Flow Execution Page:

<figure style="margin: 0;">
  <img src="/images/run-flow.png" alt="CLUI Flow Execution Page">
  <figcaption style="opacity: 0.75; font-size: 0.75em;">
    (CLUI Flow Execution Page)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

On the Flow Execution Page, we can configure our inputs (here we just have one text input), change our working directory by typing in the working directory or hitting the `cd` button. To run the flow, hit the `submit` button towards the bottom! 

> If your flow involves interacting with `stdin`, you can flush to `stdin` while a flow is running via a text input box that appears at the bottom of the command output.

After running your flow, you will see the output render to your screen like so:

<figure style="margin: 0;">
  <img src="/images/success.png" alt="CLUI Flow Execution Page Success">
  <figcaption style="opacity: 0.75; font-size: 0.75em;">
    (CLUI Flow Execution Page Success)
  </figcaption>
</figure>

If you need to edit a flow, delete a flow, or find the flow definition file on your computer, there are options to do so from the settings menu in the top right corner of the Flow Execution Page. 

When editing a flow, you can either "Update Flow" which will update the flow definition in-place, or you can "Save As New Flow" which will create a new flow based on your edits.

## Advanced Usage

### Running multiple commands in sequence

You can likely use your shell to run commands in sequence. I personally use `bash` (though any posix-compliant shell should work for this), and can write a command like so:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/Scratch/pads/1684682563953; touch ~/Scratch/pads/1684682563953/scratch.js; code ~/Scratch/pads/1684682563953;
```

This command first runs `mkdir -p ~/Scratch/pads/1684682563953` which will create a folder. After the folder is created, it will run `touch ~/Scratch/pads/1684682563953/scratch.js` which creates a file in that folder. Then it will run `code ~/Scratch/pads/1684682563953` which opens the folder in VSCode. 

### Creating flows outside of CLUI

All CLUI flows are just JSON files located in the `flows` directory in the CLUI AppData directory. Feel free to add any flows here or edit them outside of CLUI! The schema is defined as follows:

```ts
type CluiFlow = {
  // title of the flow, searchable
  title: string
  
  // description of the flow, searchable
  description: string

  // tags for the flow, searchable
  tags: string[]

  // working directory to run the flow from
  cwd?: string

  // list of dependencies for the flow (i.e. ffmpeg, python, imagemagick)
  dependencies?: (string | { name: string; url: string })[]

  // list of inputs for the flow. 
  // type 'string' creates a text input
  // - sets 'value' as contents of text input
  // type 'file' creates a file input
  // - sets 'value' as the path to the file
  inputs: {
    name: string
    value?: any
    type: 'string' | 'file' | 'boolean'
  }[]

  // command run from the CWD. 
  // - all occurences of the inputs' 'name' properties 
  //   will be replaced with their respective values
  commandBuilder: string
}
```
